Hello all!

I am Sara, a forestry engineer from the National University of Colombia.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I worked for a few years as an environmental consultant in my country Colombia, where I discovered my passion for fragmentation and landscape connectivity. Furthermore, in the <a href="https://www.udl.cat/ca/es/">University of Lleida</a>, the school I chose for the second year of my master, I learned about modeling forests and most important I had my first encounters with R.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I created this webpage with the idea of sharing the process and struggles with my thesis. Although there are a lot of resources out there, I would like to share my own tutorials and tips about landscape connectivity that I've been discovering through out the process of my thesis and my starting career as a researcher.</p>
